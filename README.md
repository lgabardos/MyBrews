# MyBrews

This project is there to help brewers to manage their brew. 
So, when you start a new brew, you will be able to configure your brew with steps, timing etc... 
Then, alarm will warn you when needed.

And of course, you will have a complete history of your brews, add comment on this one and make improvements for the next brew.
